# hello-world
this is hello world project my very first repository on github. I work as Pricing Actuary at Gen Re and I'm in love with R, RStudio, fashion and technologies.  

I'll start sharing my projects soon

I've just started setting up Github from RStudio using this book: https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#make-local-changes-save-commit-1
